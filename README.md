## HTML Structure

- ### Create header h1 tag - The CSS Blog.

-  In the navigation bar, add the anchor tag and home about contact resources to the list item.
-  Then write a section and an aside in the main section.
-  I added an article in one of the two sections. In the article section, there is an h2 tag, a heading, and two div tags.
- In the aside section below, there is an h2 tag, a header, and a place to write your email address in the form and a submit button.
-  Finally, I wrote the footer section.

### Style.css

- The style.css and rescource lines are written to be seen only after hovering and clicking.
